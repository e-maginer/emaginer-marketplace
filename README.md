## Git/GitHub Quick Start
1. [Download and install the latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [Setting your username in Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/setting-your-username-in-git)
 - [Setup your commit email address on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-on-github)
 - keep your email address private when performing web-based Git operations by clicking "Keep my email address private"
 - [Setup your commit email address in Git to use GitHub-provided no-reply email address](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git) 
 3. [Block command line pushes that expose your personal email address](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/blocking-command-line-pushes-that-expose-your-personal-email-address)
 4. [Authenticate with GitHub from Git using HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use#cloning-with-https-urls): The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires authentication, Git will prompt you for your username and password. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token (PAT) instead. Password-based authentication for Git is deprecated, and using a PAT is more secure. For more information, see "[Creating a personal access token.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)".
  - To be able to retrieve data from a repository hosted on GitHub, or share your projects, you need to register your GitHub account in IntelliJ IDEA (WebStorm). For more information, see [Register a GitHub account](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/github.html#register-account) 
  5. [Ignoring files](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/ignoring-files): use the .gitignore file in the repository's root directory to share the ignore rules with other users who clone the repository. Optionally, you can use ".git/info/exclude" file for locally-generated files that you don't expect other users to generate, such as files created by your editor. 
 
 Note: One of the cardinal rules of Git is that, since so much work is local within your clone, you have a great deal of freedom to rewrite your history locally. However, once you push your work, it is a different story entirely, and you should consider pushed work as final unless you have good reason to change it. In short, you should avoid pushing your work until you’re happy with it and ready to share it with the rest of the world.

### GitHub Workflow

Create a branch from the repository.
Create, edit, rename, move, or delete files.
Send a pull request from your branch with your proposed changes to kick off a discussion.
Make changes on your branch as needed. Your pull request will update automatically.
Merge the pull request once the branch is ready to be merged.
Tidy up your branches using the delete button in the pull request or on the branches page.
